# HubSpot API Configuration
# Get your API key from: HubSpot → Settings → Integrations → Private Apps
# Create a private app with the following scopes:
#   - crm.objects.contacts.write (to create/update contacts)
#   - forms (to submit form data)
HUBSPOT_API_KEY=your_hubspot_api_key_here

# HubSpot Form GUIDs (Optional - Alternative to API Key)
# Get these from: HubSpot → Marketing → Lead Capture → Forms → [Your Form] → Options → Form ID
# If using form submission method instead of API key
HUBSPOT_CONTACT_FORM_GUID=your_contact_form_guid_here
HUBSPOT_NEWSLETTER_FORM_GUID=your_newsletter_form_guid_here

# Note: You only need either:
#   - HUBSPOT_API_KEY (recommended - works for all forms)
#   OR
#   - HUBSPOT_CONTACT_FORM_GUID and HUBSPOT_NEWSLETTER_FORM_GUID (alternative method)
